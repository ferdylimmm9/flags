# Flag Icons Project

This project contains a collection of flag icons in SVG format, forked from the [flag-icons repository](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons). Some flags have been fixed or adjusted for better accuracy. The SVG files were then converted to WEBP format using [Fotor SVG to WEBP Converter](https://www.fotor.com/convert/svg-converter/svg-to-webp/).

## Usage

### SVG Files

The SVG files are located in the `svgs` directory. You can use them directly in your projects by referencing their file paths.

Example usage in HTML:
```html
<img src="svg/af.svg" alt="Afghanistan Flag">
```
### WEBP Files
```html
<img src="webp/af.webp" alt="Afghanistan Flag">
```
